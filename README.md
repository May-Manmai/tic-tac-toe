## How to play

This is a two player game.

**Start**

The first player will pick one of the boxes to start with. The first player is "X".

The second player will pick any of the boxes after the first player. The second player is "O".

**Game**

Players have a 3 x 3 grid to play with in. On click a token is placed onto the grid. Players alternate placing tokens until a line of three tokens in a row is formed or the grid is full of tokens.

The first player who get this 3 in a row wins.

**End**

At the end of the game the display block shows a winner. If the player want to play again then click new game button.
